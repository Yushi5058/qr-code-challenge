### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how flexbox works, and learned how to use developer tools > inspect element to see where I have a style error, and adjust it until I'm satisfied with the design to make changes in my code editor. It was quite a good experience, even though I felt dumb about searching the error for many hours.

### Continued development

I'm planning to master vanilla css and upgrade my design skills. I will try add functionalities with javascript when I finish learning it. When comfortable, I'll begin using frameworks.

### Useful resources

- Google
- Firefox developer tools
