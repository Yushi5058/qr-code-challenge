# QR Code Challenge

## Designing a QR Code Generator using Semantic HTML, CSS Custom Properties and Flexbox

### About the project

[The QR Code Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-landing-page-using-flexbox-and-pure-css-RgcmEYLr55) project was a front-end mentor project that involved creating a webpage that generates QR codes. The webpage had a form where users could input text, and upon submission, the text was converted into a QR code that could be scanned using a QR code scanner. This project provided me with an opportunity to practice and solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS  while also introducing me to new concepts such as semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, flexbox, and mobile-first workflow.
